# Smartwatch-and-Ring-3D-model
In this project we designed a ring and a personalized smartwatch

Sometimes, sleep gets the best of us when we need to be attentive. For example, those college students who work full-time and go to school tend to fall asleep during their lectures due to a lack of sleep. It would be nice to have something to help prevent this from happening and do so with. We have designed a ring that will be recommended to be worn at night to analyze an individualâ€™s body activities as they sleep. These readings will then be transferred to our personalized smartwatch with Bluetooth, which will then use that data to recognize if the owner has fallen asleep and begin to vibrate to wake them.
